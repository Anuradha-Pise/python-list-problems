Problem Statement:

Write a Python program to calculate the sum of all the elements in a list.

Solution 1:

Explanation:

Approach: Using a predefined list.


Steps:

Initialize a list list1 containing numeric elements.
Initialize a variable total to store the sum and set it to 0.
Iterate through each element in list1.
Add each element to the total variable.
Print the total sum of elements.

Solution Explanation: Utilizes a pre-defined list and iterates through its elements, adding them to a total variable to find the sum.

Solution 2:

Explanation:

Approach: Dynamically taking input for the list.

Steps:

Create an empty list list1.
Ask the user for the number of elements (num_elements) they want in the list.
Using a loop, ask the user for each element and append it to list1.
Calculate the sum of all elements in list1 using the sum() function.
Print the total sum of elements.

Solution Explanation: Dynamically creates a list based on user input and calculates the sum of its elements.
