<h1>Problem Statement:</h1>
<b>Write a Python program to calculate the sum of all the elements in a list.
</b>

<h2>Solution 1:</h2>

<h3>Approach: </h3>Using a predefined list.


<h3>Steps:</h3>
<li>Initialize a list list1 containing numeric elements.</li>
<li>Initialize a variable total to store the sum and set it to 0.</li>
<li>Iterate through each element in list1.</li>
<li>Add each element to the total variable.</li>
<li>Print the total sum of elements.</li>


<h3>Solution Explanation: </h3>
Utilizes a pre-defined list and iterates through its elements, adding them to a total variable to find the sum.

<h2>Solution 2:</h2>

<h2>Explanation:</h2>
<h3>Approach: </h3>
Dynamically taking input for the list.

<h3>Steps:</h3>
Create an empty list list1.
Ask the user for the number of elements (num_elements) they want in the list.
Using a loop, ask the user for each element and append it to list1.
Calculate the sum of all elements in list1 using the sum() function.
Print the total sum of elements.

<h3>Solution Explanation: </h3>
Dynamically creates a list based on user input and calculates the sum of its elements.
