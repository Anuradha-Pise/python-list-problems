<h1>Problem Statement:</h1>

Write a Python program to calculate the sum of all the elements in a list.

<h1>Solution 1:</h1>

<h2>Explanation:</h2>
<h3>Approach: </h3>
Using a predefined list.


<h3>Steps:</h3>
Initialize a list list1 containing numeric elements.
Initialize a variable total to store the sum and set it to 0.
Iterate through each element in list1.
Add each element to the total variable.
Print the total sum of elements.

<h3>Solution Explanation: </h3>
Utilizes a pre-defined list and iterates through its elements, adding them to a total variable to find the sum.

<h1>Solution 2:</h1>
<h2>Explanation:</h2>
<h3>Approach: </h3>
Dynamically taking input for the list.

<h3>Steps:</h3>
Create an empty list list1.
Ask the user for the number of elements (num_elements) they want in the list.
Using a loop, ask the user for each element and append it to list1.
Calculate the sum of all elements in list1 using the sum() function.
Print the total sum of elements.

<h3>Solution Explanation: </h3>
Dynamically creates a list based on user input and calculates the sum of its elements.
