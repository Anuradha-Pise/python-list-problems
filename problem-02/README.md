<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
<b>Write a Python program to multiply all the items in a list.</b>

<h2>Solution - 1</h2>

<h3>Approach :</h3>Utilizes a predefined list.

<h3>Steps :</h3>
<li>Initialize a list list1 containing numeric elements.</li>
<li>Initialize a variable total to store the sum and set it to 0.</li>
<li>Iterate through each element in list1.</li>
<li>Add each element to the total variable.</li>
<li>Print the total sum of elements.</li>

<h3>Solution Explanation :</h3>This solution employs a pre-defined list and iterates through its elements, aggregating them into a total variable to determine the sum.

<h2>Solution - 2</h2>

<h3>Approach :</h3>Dynamically takes input for the list.

<h3>Steps :</h3>
<li>Create an empty list list1.</li>
<li>Ask the user for the number of elements (num_elements) they want in the list.</li>
<li>Using a loop, prompt the user for each element and append it to list1.</li>
<li>Calculate the sum of all elements in list1 using the sum() function.</li>
<li>Print the total sum of elements.</li>

<h3>Solution Explanation :</h3>This solution dynamically constructs a list based on user input and computes the sum of its elements using the sum() function.
